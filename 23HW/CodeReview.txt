Checkers by Joseph Gelb and Ari Hatzimemos

The first part of the code with the visuals are setup is pretty confusing, comments would help explain what the characters are meant to do. I also don't see the point of the toString method. Moving is pretty easy to understand. To be honest, I feel a GUI wouldn't have been that hard, (and is still doable), but this is fine. For doMove there isn't a whole lot of comments and I don't get the purpose of the x's and o's. The computer's moves are understandable to an extent, but the code overall isn't very clear.
